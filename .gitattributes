# see https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/.gitattributes

# This line does two things:
# - forces git to use LF
# - tell git to guess whether files are text or binary
*                       text=auto eol=lf

# Mark generated files as binary to prevent git from trying to merge them
/.pnp.*                 binary linguist-generated

# Set the language for these files to json5 to ensure GitHub doesn't show 
# the comments as errors
/.vscode/*.json         linguist-language=JSON5

# Hide .yarn and docs from GitHub's language detection
/.yarn/**               linguist-vendored
/docs/**                linguist-documentation

# Tip: You can also add a .gitattributes file to identify the release and 
# plugin bundles as binary content. This way Git won't bother showing massive
# diffs when each time you subsequently add or update them:
/.yarn/releases/**      binary linguist-vendored
/.yarn/plugins/**       binary linguist-vendored
